        <p>Hi there! My name is Natalie (as you can tell) and I am web developer! This is my personal portfolio page
            that showcases my personal projects and projects that I completed at university. I have a bit of an
            interesting background: I graduated from Sydney University in 2016 after completing a Bachelors Degree in
            Mathematics. After working in the media industry as a Data Analyst I felt like I wanted to pursue something
            more creative, hence discovering web development and falling in love with it! As well as having an
            understanding in web languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery I also have a keen understanding in
            statistical techniques, data visualisation, and analytics from my time as an analyst.</p>
